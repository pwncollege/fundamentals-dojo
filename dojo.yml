  Before we run, we must learn to walk.
  This dojo is designed to expose the student to the fundamentals of the art of hacking.
  These fundamentals might seem, to some, as basic as waxing a car, but between the rounds of Wax On, Wax Off, you will find, deep within, the stirrings of the beginnings of true skills of security.
  As you embark on this journey, remember: this is only the beginning.

      This level has a "decoy" solution that _looks_ like it leaks the flag, but is not correct.
      If you're submitting what you feel should be a valid flag, and the dojo doesn't accept it, try your solution against a file with uppercase characters to see what's going on.

      - For launching programs from Python, we recommend using [pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/intro.html), but [subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) should work as well. If you are not using one of these two, you will suffer heavily when you get to input redirection (for that, check out the `stdin` and `stdout` arguments to `pwn.process` or `subprocess.Popen`).
      - For reading and writing directly to file descriptors in bash, check out the `read` and `echo` builtins.
      - You will find the `env` command useful, and the `exec` bash builtin.
      - Quick refreshers on `fork()` versus `exec*()` [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-fork-exec/) and [here](https://linuxhint.com/linux-exec-system-call/) and [here](https://iximiuz.com/en/posts/how-to-on-processes/).
      - Remember to `wait()` on your children! If you use `subprocess.Popen`, `pwn.process`, or good old `fork()`, your parent will keep executing and, unless it waits for the child in some way, will just terminate! This is almost never what you want.
      - Some [documentation](https://www.binarytides.com/socket-programming-c-linux-tutorial/) on networking in C.
      - Useful resource for [pipes in C](https://jameshfisher.com/2017/02/17/how-do-i-call-a-program-in-c-with-pipes/).
      - Useful resource for [FIFOs in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/named-pipe-fifo-example-c-program/).
      - A treatise on I/O redirection in Linux shells, which has applications in this assignment: [https://web.archive.org/web/20220629044814/http://bencane.com:80/2012/04/16/unix-shell-the-art-of-io-redirection/](https://web.archive.org/web/20220629044814/http://bencane.com:80/2012/04/16/unix-shell-the-art-of-io-redirection/)
      - A guide on Linux symbolic links. [https://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/](https://www.nixtutor.com/freebsd/understanding-symbolic-links/)
      - A video tutorial on [FIFOs in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hba3etpoJg).
