      Obviously, as you're accessing this website in your web browser, this isn't your _first_ HTTP request.
      But it's your first HTTP request for a pwn.college challenge!
      Run `/challenge/run`, fire up Firefox in the dojo workspace (you'll need to use the [GUI Desktop](/workspace/desktop) for this!), and visit the URL that it's listening on for the flag!

      Awesome, you got the hang of the basic process.
      There's one more thing you need to do, though: you must read and understand the source code of the challenge!
      Web servers _route_ HTTP requests to different _endpoints_: `http://challenge.localhost/pwn` might go to the endpoint that handles the request path `/pwn`, and `http://challenge.localhost/college` might go to the endpoint that handles the request path `college`.
      This challenge has a randomly-chosen endpoint name.
      You must read the code in `/challenge/run`, understand it, and figure out which endpoint to visit in the browser!

      ----
      Confused?
      Our web servers are implemented using the [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/) library.
      Read their documentation to build up understanding of the code, or experiment with it!

      HTTP is the _HyperText_ Transfer Protocol.
      HyperText, named in the techno-optimism of the late 20th century, is text that carries additional data regarding _how_ it should be understood, not just what it means.
      In modern times, this is done through a variety of means: HTTP is used to transport lots of different types of resources, and your web browser combines them to construct the websites that you see and interact with.
      The oldest of these is the HyperText Markup Language, or HTML.

      HTML describes, in a way that the browser can interpret, the elements that should (initially) appear on a web page.
      We'll dive into HTML subtleties in later modules, but here, we'll practice piercing the veil of the website and looking at the HTML behind it all.
      You'll need to, as before, find the endpoint and access it in the in-dojo browser.
      However, the HTML sent over will _hide_ the flag.
      You'll need to figure out how to view the Page Source of the HTML, rather than the rendered result, to access this hidden data.

      **HINT:** click Firefox's Hamburger menu (≡), then go to `More Tools`.

      HTTP facilitates the transfer of both _data_ (e.g., the HTML that `/challenge/run` sends you) and _metadata_ (data about the data).
      The latter is sent via _headers_: fields in an HTTP request or response that give additional instructions to the server or browser.
      In this case, the flag is in a header.
      Can you find it?

      ----
      **HINT:** you can inspect headers using Firefox's Web Developer Tools (≡, then `More Tools`).
      The Network tab of the tools displays all of the HTTP connections (you might need to reload the page after opening the Web Developer Tools for the connection to show up).
      Each of these connections has a `Headers` subtab, which shows headers that your browser sent alongside its request (`Request Headers`) and the headers that it received alongside the response (`Response Headers`).
      Find the flag header there!

      You've learned how to HTTP (though, of course, you've probably been HTTPing for most of your life!).
      Now, let's learn how to _really_ HTTP.
      The HTTP protocol itself, as in the exact data that is sent over the network, is actually surprisingly human-readable and human-writable.
      In this challenge, you'll learn to write it.
      This challenge requires you to use a program called "netcat" (command name: `nc`), which is a simple program that communicates over a network connection.
      Netcat's basic usage involves two arguments: the _hostname_ (where the server is listening on, such as www.google.com for Google), and the port (the standard HTTP port is 80).

      When it starts up, netcat connects to the server and gives you a raw channel to communicate with it.
      You'll be talking _directly with the web server_, with no intermediary!
      How cool is that?

      Recall the lectures, find the format of an HTTP request, and make a GET request to the `/` endpoint (we'll do more endpoints later) to get the flag!

      ----
      **HINT:**
      Can't tell if netcat is connecting or not?
      Use the `-v` flag to turn on some verbosity!

      **HINT:**
      Typed your GET request and nothing happens after you hit Enter?
      HTTP requests are terminated by _two_ newlines.
      Try hitting Enter again!

      **A thought...**
      Until this moment, have you ever truly HTTPed?

      Next, we'll practice making HTTP requests with one of the most common commandline tools for HTTP: `curl`.
      Unlike netcat, curl is made specifically for HTTP, and you don't have to write raw HTTP commands.
      Instead, you must learn to the right program options to achieve what you want.
      Here, you must simply make a GET request to the right endpoint!

      Finally, we'll learn the fourth tool in our HTTP toolbox: Python's [requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
      This, along with the browser, will likely be the two most heavily used tools in your HTTP toolbox.
      Requests lets you script complex web interactions, and this will be necessary to pull off tricky hacks later.
      For now, things are simple: pull up Python, `import requests`, and GET the flag!

    description: |
      Unfortunately, most of the modern internet runs on the infrastructure of a handful of companies, and a given server run by these companies might be responsible for serving up websites for dozens of different domain names.
      How does the server decide which website to serve?
      The `Host` header.

      The `Host` header is a _request_ header sent by the client (e.g., browser, curl, etc), typically equal to the domain name entered in the HTTP request.
      When you go to `https://pwn.college`, your browser automatically sets the `Host` header to `pwn.college`, and thus our server knows to give you the `pwn.college` website, rather than something else.

      Until now, the challenges you've been interacting with have been `Host`-agnostic.
      Now they start checking.
      Set the right `Host` header and get the flag!

      And, finally, you can learn how Hosts are _actually_ sent over the network in netcat.
      This might be a bit trickier.
      You can actually use `curl` as a source of information here!
      Curl's `-v` option causes it to print out the exact headers it's sending over (and the ones it receives!).
      Observe it, copy that with netcat, and get the flag!

    description: |
      Recall how HTTP requests contain fields separated by spaces?
      For example: `GET /solve HTTP/1.1`.
      What if the path (e.g., instead of `/solve`) has spaces inside it?
      This is a reasonable thing to happen, as these paths often reference directories, and directories may have spaces in their names!

      Left to their own devices, spaces would mess up the HTTP request.
      Consider an HTTP server trying to make sense of `GET /solve my challenge HTTP/1.1`.
      A clever server might be able to deal with it, but it's not impossible that a version that simply reads one word at a time would read `my` instead of `HTTP/1.1` and panic!

      To avoid such situations, URLs are _encoded_ using [URL Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).
      This is a simple encoding compared to what you've seen in [Dealing with Data](/fundamentals/data_dealings).
      Any tricky characters (such as spaces) are simply hex-encoded, with a `%` plopped in front of them.
      Of course, because `%` thus becomes a tricky character in itself, it must also be encoded.
      In the above example, `/solve my challenge` would become `/solve%20my%20challenge`, as the hex value of the ASCII space character is `0x20`.

      Anyways, now we'll practice.
      We stuck spaces in the endpoints.
      Can you still get the flag?

      ----
      **INFO:**
      You'll find that you need to encode URLs with curl as well (though we won't make you jump through that hoop), in the exact same way.
      Python's requests library, however, will automatically urlencode things for you.
      So useful!

    description: |
      Like a function call in a programming language or a command execution on the shell, HTTP requests can include _parameters_.
      GET requests send parameters alongside the path in the URL, in a part of the URL called the [Query String](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string).
      In this challenge, you'll learn how to craft this query string.
      Read the challenge source to understand what parameter you need, and send it over!
      You can use any client you want: the process is basically the same in all of them.

      ----
      **SECURITY NOTE:**
      It's tempting to think of HTTP parameters as similar to parameters to a function call.
      However, keep in mind: when you're writing C or Python or Java code, an attacker (typically) can't just call random functions in your program with random parameters.
      But with HTTP, they _can_.
      They can just make HTTP requests wherever they want!
      This has caused quote a few security issues...

      HTTP GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, and the parameters typically represent data identifiers and various customizations for its retrieval and display.
