    Let's start your journey through encodings with something simple.
    This program takes a password, but you have no way to know what it is...
    unless you _READ_ it!

    In most cybersecurity analysis settings, you will be analyzing software that you did not write, like this program.
    Thus, the very first skill you will learn in this module is to read software to understand what is the data that it wants you to send.
    We'll start with this trivial Python program.

    The program lives in `/challenge/runme`, and will request a tricky password before it gives you the flag.
    It's going to be the simplest program you read in your journey, as it just reads data over standard input and makes one simple check.

    Read the program, understand the Python, and make the program give you the flag!

    The previous challenges were quite simple, as is this one.
    But it does one thing slightly differently: it does not ignore the Enter that you press on the terminal when entering your password.
    This causes your `entered_password` to contain a newline, and since `correct_password` has no newline, the comparison fails!

    This sort of stuff --- errant delimiters in data --- happens ALL the time and can lead to crazy amounts of lost time.
    There are a few ways to get around it in this level:

    1. Look into ways to terminate your terminal input _without_ pressing Enter.
       This is super searchable online!
    2. Recall, from the Linux Luminarium, how to redirect an `echo` (with arguments to disable newlines) to the stdin of `/challenge/runme`.
    3. Create a file without a newline, and remember your Linux Luminarium to redirect the file to stdin of `/challenge/runme`.

    Good luck!

    Now, life must get complex.
    You may have noticed the `b` letters in front of the password constants throughout this module.
    Python has two types of string-like constants: `str`ings (specified as `"asdf"`) and `bytes` (specified as `b"asdf"`).
    Let's talk about `bytes` in this level.

    Bytes are what is actually stored in your computer's memory.
    As you might know, computers think in binary: just a bunch of ones and zeroes.
    For historical reasons, we express these ones and zeroes ("bits") in groups of 8, and each group of 8 (a "byte").
    This number is purely arbitrary: early computers (pre-1960s or so) didn't have this grouping at all, or had other arbitrary groupings.
    It is very feasible for there to be an alternate universe in which a byte is 16, 32, or really any numbers of bits (though for math reasons, it'll likely remain a power-of-2).

    A single binary digit (bit) can represent two values (`0` and `1`), two bits can represent four values (`00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`), three bits can represent eight values (`000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `100`, `101`, `110`, `111`), and four bits can represent sixteen values.
    Compartively, a single decimal digit can represent 10 values (from `0` to `9`).
    Ten values are represented by roughly `log2(10) == 3.3219...` bits, and you get weird situations like binary `1001` being decimal `9`, but binary `1100` (still 4 binary digits) being `12` (_two_ decimal digits!).
    Another way of expressing this digit desynchronization between decimal and binary is that decimal does not have clean _bit boundaries_.

    The lack of bit boundaries makes reasoning about the relationship between decimal and binary complex.
    For example, it is hard to spot-translate numbers between decimal and binary in general: we can work out that `97` is `110001`, but it's hard to see that at a glance.

    It's much easier to spot-translate between bases that have more alignment between digits.
    For example, a single hexadecimal (base 16) digit can represent 16 values (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`): the same number of values that binary can represent in 4 digits!
    This allows us to have a super simple mapping:

    | Hex | Binary | Decimal |
    |-----|--------|---------|
    | `0` | `0000` | `0`     |
    | `1` | `0001` | `1`     |
    | `2` | `0010` | `2`     |
    | `3` | `0011` | `3`     |
    | `4` | `0100` | `4`     |
    | `5` | `0101` | `5`     |
    | `6` | `0110` | `6`     |
    | `7` | `0111` | `7`     |
    | `8` | `1000` | `8`     |
    | `9` | `1001` | `9`     |
    | `a` | `1010` | `10`    |
    | `b` | `1011` | `11`    |
    | `c` | `1100` | `12`    |
    | `d` | `1101` | `13`    |
    | `e` | `1110` | `14`    |
    | `f` | `1111` | `15`    |

    This mapping from a hex digit to 4 bits is something that's easily memorizable (most important: memorize `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`, and you can quickly derive the rest).
    Better yet, two hex digits is **8** bits, which is one byte!
    Unlike decimal, where you'd have to memorize 16 mappings for 4 bits and 256 mappings for 8 bits, with hexadecimal, you only have to memorize 16 mappings for 4 bits and the same amount of mappings for 8 bits, since it's just two hexadecimal digits concatenated!
    Some examples:

    | Hex  | Binary      | Decimal |
    |------|-------------|---------|
    | `00` | `0000 0000` | `0`     |
    | `0e` | `0000 1110` | `14`    |
    | `3e` | `0011 1110` | `62`    |
    | `e3` | `1110 0011` | `227`   |
    | `ee` | `1110 1110` | `238`   |

    Now you're starting to see the beauty.
    This gets even more obvious when you expand beyond one byte of input, but we'll let you find that out through future challenges!

    Now, let's talk about notation.
    How do you differentiate `11` in decimal, `11` in binary (which equals `3` in decimal), and 11 in hex (which equals `17` in decimal)?
    For numerical constants, Python's notation is to prepend binary data with `0b`, hexadecimal with `0x`, and keep decimal as is, resulting in `11 == 0b1011 == 0xb`, `3 == 0b11 == 0x3`, and `17 == 0b10001 == 0x11`.
    But for `bytes`, as in this challenge, you can specify them using _escape sequences_.
    The escape sequence starts with `\x` and is followed by two hex digits, resulting in a single byte with that value being put in the `bytes` constant!

    Armed with this knowledge, go and hex the challenge and get the flag!

    **Fun facts:**
    Some other Pythonisms that might be useful:

    - If you `print(n)` a number or convert it to a string with `str(n)`, the number will be represented in base 10.
    - You can get a hexadecimal string representation of a number using `hex(n)`.
    - You can get a binary string representation of a number using `bin(n)`.
    - Converting a string to a number with `int(s)` will read it as a base 10 number by default.
    - You can specify a different base to use with a second argument: `int(s, 16)` will interpret the string as hex, `int(s, 2)` will interpret it as binary.
    - You can try to auto-identify the number base using `int(s, 0)`, which requires a prefex on the string (`0b` or binary, `0x` for hex, nothing for decimal).

    You're not limited to two hex digits!
    Like decimal numbers, you can add arbitrary amounts of them to represent more and more bytes.
    Every two hex digits are one additional byte.
    One hex digit, for those curious, is called a _nibble_ (har har!), but this is not used when specifying data.
    We almost always work with data on the _byte_ level, not less.

    What you will do in this level is _hex encode_ arbitrary data.
    That is, you will figure out what value you want your data to have at the end, _encode_ that value in hex, and send the hex bytes.
    Wow, your first encoding!

    **NOTE:**
    One of the toughest parts of this challenge is to send raw binary data to it stdin.
    There are a few ways to do this:

    1. Write a python script to output data to stdout and pipe that to the challenge's stdin!
       This would involve using the raw byte interface to stdout: `sys.stdout.buffer.write()`.
    2. Write a python script to run the challenge and interact with it directly.
       Our recommendation is to use pwntools for this: `import pwn`, `p = pwn.process("/challenge/runme")`, `p.write()`, and `p.readall()`.
       A pwn.college alumni has created an awesome [pwntools cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/anvbis/64907e4f90974c4bdd930baeb705dedf) that you may reference.
    3. For an increasingly hacky solution, `echo -e -n "\xAA\xBB"` will print out bytes to stdout that you can pipe.

    Now, let's talk about `str`ings!
    In Python, strings are meant for human consumption.
    A string is a sequence of characters that a human might write down, read, speak, and dream.
    This includes things like letters of the alphabet but also things like 🕴️.
    When one thinks about how many different letters of different alphabets and different emoji and so on there are, it's clear that there are _thousands_ of different options for each character of a string.

    The representation of a human-readable character as a bunch of bytes in memory is yet another _Encoding_ (here, used as a noun).
    A character, such as 🐉, is "encoded" (here, used as a verb) by bytes in memory, and those bytes "decode" to that character.
    In this use of "encoding" and "decoding", the data actually stays the same, but its interpretation changes: the encoding is applied by, say, your commandline terminal to translate the bytes being sent by the program into the characters and emoji you see on the screen.

    In Python, you convert a `str` to its equivalent `bytes` by doing `my_string.encode()`.
    If you have a bunch of bytes that you want to interpret as a string, you can do `my_bytes.decode()`.
    But how are string characters mapped to byte values?

    Back in its early days (say, pre-2000), when computing was less international and people still typed `:-)` instead of 🙂, people didn't really worry about the limited number of characters that a single byte could represent.
    Thus, early encodings simply encoded each character to be a single byte, with a resulting limit of 256 possible characters.
    Because early computing was predominantly US- and Western Europe-based, the most popular such encoding, specifically designed to represent characters in the Latin alphabet with various byte values, was [_ASCII_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), dating back to 1963 (ancient history by computing standards!).

    ASCII is pretty simple: every character is one byte, uppercase letters are `0x40+letter_index` (e.g., A is `0x41`, F is `0x46`, and Z is `0x5a`), lowercase letters are `0x60+letter_index` (a is `0x61`, f is `0x66`, and z is `0x7a`), and numbers (yes, the numeric characters you're seeing are _not_ bytes of those values, they are ASCII-encoded number characters) are `0x30+number`, so 0 is `0x30` and 7 is `0x37`.
    Useful special characters are sprinkled around the mapping as well: forward slash (`/` is `0x2f`), space is `0x20`, and newline is 0x0a.
    Because early computing pioneers were making stuff up as they went along, some of the ASCII characters aren't really characters: `0x07` is a _bell_; it literally makes your terminal beep when it is "printed" out!
    Other "control characters" do other whacky things: `0x08`, for example, _deletes the last character_ on the terminal instead of being a character itself.

    Byte values below `0x80` (`128`), considered "standard ASCII", were pretty universally defined even for non-English countries.
    You can see this whole standard ASCII definition with `man ascii`!
    You can also use standard ASCII in python to encode strings: `my_string.encode("ascii")`.
    But beware, standard ASCII doesn't define values above `0x80`, so if you _decode_ bytes that have those values, you will get an exception!
    This, for example, won't work: `b"\x80".decode("ascii")`.

    Values _above_ `0x80` ("extended ASCII") were used by different countries for their own characters, leading to some chaos due to colliding byte values.
    In the US, the typical "extended ASCII" encoding was called [Latin 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1), and it defined a character for each of the 256 possible byte values.
    This is useful for us because we can use "latin1" to easily convert between Python's bytes and strings, including: `b"\x80".decode("latin1")`.

    In this challenge, we want you to give us ASCII-encoded hex values (fun fact: specifying byte values in hexadecimal is called "hex encoding"!), and we'll match them against the password.
    Good luck!

    ---
    **NOTE:**
    As you read the challenge to understand what value you need to send, you'll notice that some parts of the `bytes` constant specified for `correct_password` looks ... weird.
    Each byte in `correct_password` represents a byte in memory, but they often still have useful, human-relevant information.
    Printing _every_ byte with escape sequences, though it would be valid, would not be as useful for humans, even if bytes aren't _really_ meant for human consumption.
    Thus, the Python developers decided to represent bytes as ... standard ASCII!
    Python `bytes` are specified using ASCII characters, with the weirder "non-printable" ones (e.g., anything over `0x80` and a few others are specified using `\x` _escape sequences_).
    This can work for normal characters as well: `\x41` happily encodes `A`.
    Some other special characters have their own bespoke escape sequences: for example, `\n` encodes a newline character (equivalent to `\x0a`).
    You can see other escape sequences in `man ascii`.
    Because `\` is used as an escape sequence, Python (and other languages that use the escape sequence concept, which is almost everything) must specify an _actual_ backslash as an escape sequence as well (specifically, `\\` encodes a `\` byte with a value of `0x5c`).

    Okay, that was a lot.
    Go put it into practice!

    Once computing went international and emojis were added, people needed to be able to use more than 256 possible characters at a time.
    In the modern era, this has been largely solved by the [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoding.
    UTF-8 is a specific multi-byte encoding of [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), a global standardized character set containing essentially all characters known to humanity, plus the fun emoji that you know and love.
    There are many ways to encode Unicode, and UTF-8 is one of them.
    Unicode (character set) is to UTF-8 (encoding) as English (character set) is to standard ASCII (encoding).

    Conveniently, UTF-8 is backwards-compatible with standard ASCII (e.g., standard ASCII byte values represent the same character in UTF-8 as in ASCII), but in certain situations will use _more than one byte_ to represent a single character.
    This allows UTF-8 to have essentially limitless character options (it can always interpret more bytes!): currently, it supports well over 1,000,000 characters!

    UTF-8 is (by default) how Python's strings are specified, so you can do stuff like `my_string = "💥"`).
    You can convert that into the actual byte representation (as it's stored in bytes in memory) by doing `my_string.encode("utf-8")` which, in the case of the emoji in question, results in the bytes `b'\xf0\x9f\x92\xa5'`.
    Those four bytes represent that emoji in UTF-8.

    In this challenge, you will learn to craft emoji bytes.
    We want you to create raw bytes representing UTF-8 emoji, hex-encode them, and send those hex values to us.
    Can you do it?

    UTF-8 is the current king of encodings.
    It is used, for example, by the [vast majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popularity_of_text_encodings) of websites on the internet.

    But it's not the only game in town.
    Outside of the web, other encodings are present in significant numbers.
    For various (misguided) technical reasons, Windows systems often use a different Unicode encoding: UTF-16.
    This encoding represents the same Unicode characters _using different byte values_!
    Needless to say, this leads to much confusion, and occasionally, security vulnerabilities.

    A common way encoding mixups lead to security vulnerabilities is by incorrectly decoding data to perform security checks, then correctly (and differently) decoding it later to actually carry out security-sensitive actions.
    If security checks are performed on bad data, then dangerous data can be missed.

    This is the case in this challenge.

    So far, we have seen a few types of encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, extended ASCII (latin-1), and hex encoding.
    This encoding translates data, whether that's a concept such as a 🎈 emoji character or an actual byte in memory into other bytes.
    What happens when you mess with the encoded data?
    Nothing good!
    In UTF-8, 🎈 encodes to:

    ```console
    hacker@dojo:~$ ipython
    In [1]: "🎈".encode("utf-8")
    Out[1]: b'\xf0\x9f\x8e\x88'
    ```

    If we mess with the resulting bytes, and then decode them, we would (of course) get something different:

    ```console
    In [2]: b'\xf0\x9f\x8e\xaa'.decode("utf-8")
    Out[2]: '🎪'

    In [3]: b'\xf0\x9f\x8e\x42'.decode("utf-8")
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
    Cell In[3], line 1
    ----> 1 b'\xf0\x9f\x8e\x42'.decode("utf-8")

    UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode bytes in position 0-2: invalid continuation byte
    ```

    The first modification resulted in a different emoji, and the second one errored out.
    Depending on the encoding, not all byte values can be decoded properly!
    For UTF-8, this is due to a complex algorithm to specify the data.
    For hex encoding, this is due to only numbers 0 through 9 and letters A through F being valid in hexadecimal!

    All this being said, any encoding _can_ be messed with to some extent, as we can see in the first example above.
    When a security flaw allows data to be corrupted, this can enable an attacker to carefully transform data to their purposes.
    We'll learn about how to protect data from this later in pwn.college, but for now, let's practice this concept by seeing what happens when we mess with some hex!

    ASCII and UTF-8 are encodings meant for very specific data: text (or text-like characters).
    Hex encoding is more general, and you can apply it to any data.
    The reason that we might use an encoding like hex is to transfer information via some medium where it is hard to write arbitrary binary code, such as a piece of paper or certain communication protocols.
    However, it is horribly inefficient: it _doubles_ the size of the data by outputting two ASCII hex digits for every byte!

    Hex is inefficient for a similar reason that it convenient: there are only 4 bits available per digit, and since each output character digit takes 8 bits to display (in ASCII), the data size doubles.
    Luckily, we can increase the efficiency of an encoding by increasing the number of bits we can convey per output character.

    The name "base64" comes from the fact that there are 64 characters used in each output character.
    These can actually vary, but the standard base64 encoding uses an "alphabet" of the uppercase letters `A` through `Z`, the lowercase letters `a` through `z`, the digits `0` through `9`, and the `+` and `/` symbols.
    This results in 64 total output symbols, and each symbol can encode `2**6` (2 to the power of 6) possible input symbols, or 6 bits of data.
    That means that two encode a single byte (8 bits) of input, you need more than one base64 output character.
    In fact, you need _two_: one that encodes the first 6 bits and one that encodes the remaining 2 (with 4 bits of that second output character being unused).
    To mark these unused bits, base64 encoded data appends an `=` for every two unused bits.
    For example:

    ```console
    hacker@dojo:~$ echo -n A | base64
    QQ==
    hacker@dojo:~$ echo -n AA | base64
    QUE=
    hacker@dojo:~$ echo -n AAA | base64
    QUFB
    hacker@dojo:~$ echo -n AAAA | base64
    QUFBQQ==
    hacker@dojo:~$
    ```

    As you can see, 3 bytes (`3*8 == 24` bits) encode precisely into 4 base64 characters (`4*6 == 24` bits).

    base64 is a popular encoding because it can represent any data without using "tricky" characters such as newlines, spaces, quotes, semicolons, unprintable special characters, and so on.
    Such characters can cause trouble in certain scenarios, and base64-encoding the data avoids this nicely.

    You've also explored other "base" encodings: base2 is binary, and base16 is hex!

    Now, go and decode your way to the flag!

    ----
    **HINT:**
    You can use Python's `base64` module (note: the base64 decoding functions in this module consume and return Python bytes) or the `base64` command line utility to do this!

    **FUN FACT:**
    The flag data in `pwn.college{FLAG}` is actually base64-encoded ciphertext.
    You're well on the way to being able to build something like the dojo!

    Security-oblivious developers often use encoding-based obfuscation in lieu of encryption.
    This sort of obfuscation typically fails to prevent determined hackers from accessing the data in question, especially once they read the software logic implementing it.
    Put yourself in the shoes of such a hacker, and get this flag.

    Remember: "Good Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal!"
    When you're doing security analysis and need to interact with bespoke software, ripping the implementations of custom communication protocols out of that software is a good way to reach interoperability.
    Give it a try here!
