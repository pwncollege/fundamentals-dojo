Computer software communicates with each other by exchanging variously-formatted data via various communication channels.
Learning about this concurrently with learning about security concepts can be overwhelming, and thus, this module tries to prepare you for the latter by covering the former.

In this module, you will learn the different ways data is reasoned about by programs.
In the future, this will help you carefully craft that data to break the recipient program's security!
